# Tec Class - Classroom Automation and Attendance Control System

## üìö Libraries Used

This project utilizes several third-party libraries to implement its functionalities. It is important to note that these libraries were not created by me. Below is a list of the libraries used:

1. **Arduino-IRremote**
   - This library allows for sending and receiving infrared signals, facilitating communication with remote devices.

2. **DHT-sensor-library**
   - Used to read data from DHT11 and DHT22 temperature and humidity sensors, enabling environmental monitoring.

3. **Ethernet.h**
   - Provides functionalities for Ethernet communication, allowing the Arduino to connect to the internet.

4. **FastLED.h**
   - A library for controlling addressable LEDs, enabling animations and light effects in LED projects.

5. **MFRC522.h**
   - This library is used for communication with RFID modules, allowing the reading of RFID tags.

6. **SPI.h**
   - A serial communication library necessary for interacting with devices that use the SPI interface, such as the MFRC522.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note
All the mentioned libraries are open-source and can be found in their respective repositories. I appreciate the developers for their valuable contributions to the community!
